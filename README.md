### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science and Engineering and a member of both the <a href="https://hxi.ucsd.edu">Human-centered eXtended Intelligence Research Lab</a>) and the <a href="https://designlab.ucsd.edu">Design Lab</a> at UC San Diego.

My dissertation focuses on the sensing of nonverbal behavior between doctors and patients in order to elucidate links between communication and equitable health outcomes. I use mixed methods to understand interpersonal interactions and contextual dynamics, and my work seeks to inform the design of future AI systems to better facilitate human collaboration.

My work spans the fields of user experience, biomedical informatics, human behavior sensing, and applied machine learning.
