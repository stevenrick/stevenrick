### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate jointly appointed in the <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/">MIT Sloan School of Management</a> and <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/">CSAIL</a>. I'm a member of the <a href="https://cci.mit.edu/">Center for Collective Intelligence</a>.

Previoiusly I recieved my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from UC San Diego where I was a member of both the <a href="https://hxi.ucsd.edu">Human-centered eXtended Intelligence Research Lab</a> and the <a href="https://designlab.ucsd.edu">Design Lab</a>.

My dissertation focused on the sensing of nonverbal behavior between doctors and patients in order to elucidate links between communication and equitable health outcomes. I used mixed methods to understand interpersonal interactions and contextual dynamics, and my work seeks to inform the design of future AI systems to better facilitate human collaboration.

My work generally spans the fields of human-centered design, human behavior sensing, biomedical informatics, language understanding (ASR/NLU), and applied machine learning.
